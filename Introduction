Aerodrome Finance is the leading DEX on Base, launched on August 28, 2023, as a fork of Velodrome V2, utilizing the ve(3,3) model by Andre Cronje. It serves as the central liquidity hub for Base, with over $1.4 billion in Total Value Locked (TVL) and 90% of Base’s trading volume through its Slipstream pools.
